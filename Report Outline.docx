ITEM 3:

Subsystem implementation
1. Movement of the mBot
Right:
To achieve movement toward the right, the right motor spins in the forward direction while the left motor spins in the backward direction.
Left:
To achieve movement toward the left, the left motor spins in the forward direction while the right motor spins in the backward direction.
Forward:
To achieve movement in the forward direction, both the motors spin at the same time in the same direction.
U turn to the right:
We implement the movement in the right direction, but we pause the program for more time by increasing the argument to the delay() function.
U turn to the left:
We implement the movement in the left direction, but we pause the program for more time by increasing the argument to the delay() function.

2. IR sensors

3.. Colour sensors(Black Line)
There are two IR sensors at the base of the mBot. If both the IR sensors are within the black line, the mBot stops and solves the waypoint(Color Detection) challenge,else
it continues to move.

4. Color Challenge Color Detection
In the studio that we did for detecting color with an LDR, the resistance and hence voltage changed with the intensity of the light. Here, 
we made use of the light intensity to determine the color of the paper above the robot. The process is as follows: The robot has 2 leds at the top which can emit light, and we
set them to emit red, green then blue light in order, and detect the intensities of the light in order, before converting them to their rough RGB values. In the code, we did not specify 
exactly what range of RGB values to consider for each color, rather, we used a comparison of the colour components to determine what challenge to execute. (show code here and link)

The calibration was done during a studio session 2 weeks before the final presentation. It involved using the mBot to obtain the light intensity values for white and black papers.
The difference between the intensities is taken, and stored in an array in the actual code for the mBot. When the mBot executes its color detection sequence, it compares the intensities
it captures with the array from calibration, and scales it to 255, to get the RGB values. This would also mean that for some cases, it is possible that we obtain RGB values in the
negative range, or greater than 255, which is our reason for using comparisons between the red/blue/green intensities to determine the color overhead.

5. End Music
The end music is played through the buzzer on the mBot. It is a very simplified version of Astronomia, and the values of frequencies of each
note was taken from the makeblock example codes for the buzzer test.
